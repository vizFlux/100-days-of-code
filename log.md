# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 14, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Show Local Weather on FreeCodeCamp. Chained Promises with [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

**Thoughts:** Started with separated request, but had difficulties on retrieving `lat` and `lon` from first request(for location) on second request(for weather based on current location). Figured out through chaining method. Struggled alot on the figuring part, indicates more in-depth understanding on the syntax is needed.
