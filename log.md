# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 14, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Show Local Weather on FreeCodeCamp. Chained Promises with [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

**Thoughts:** Started with separated request, but had difficulties on retrieving `lat` and `lon` from first request(for location) on second request(for weather based on current location). Figured out through chaining method. Struggled alot on the figuring part, indicates more in-depth understanding on the syntax is needed.

### Day 1: January 15, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Show Local Weather on FreeCodeCamp. Failed in attempt of adding function to convert weather from metric to imperial.

**Thoughts:** Struggled hours to add conversion function on `this.setState` in `handleClick()`.
```JavaScript
handleClick() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      isMetric: !prevState.isMetric,
      unit: !prevState.unit,
      temp: () => {
        if (prevState.isMetric === true) {
          return {
            temp: prevState.temp * 9/5 + 32,
          }
        }
      }
    }));
```
Failed and will try to fix it by tomorrow again.
